Codebase for my thesis titled ["Utilizing Machine Learning Techniques to Identify Autism Spectrum Disorder Using fMRI Data"](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2900856024?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses)

## Abstract:
This study extensively investigates Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classification by
analyzing functional connectivity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. ASD is a neurological development disorder affecting 1 in 36 US children,
underscoring the importance of early detection for effective intervention. Using Autism
Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) fMRI data, this research evaluates the predictive
capabilities of the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL), cc200, and cc400 brain atlases. Functional connectivity is assessed through correlation, covariance, tangent, partial
correlation, and precision measures. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a proposed
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are employed for classifying ASD, with the CNN
achieving comparable results: 68.11% accuracy, 73.45% AUC, 73.41% recall, and 69.27%
precision. Notably, correlation, tangent, and covariance measures show robust performance
across the assessed brain atlases. This research provides valuable contributions by thoroughly comparing various functional connectivity analyses for ASD classification, shedding
new light on their comparative effectiveness.

## Repo Description
In this repository, you will find the python scripts used for compiling, training, and testing all CNN and SVM models.
